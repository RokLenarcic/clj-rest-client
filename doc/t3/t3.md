# Tutorial 3 - Client object

While we have a running example where request is made with credentials, etc...

But what most people want is a client that they can create with parameters injected from an environment.

This library doesn't provide anything specific but we will develop something anyway.

We've left tutorial 2 with this:

```clojure
(defrest
  {"https://api.github.com"
   {["users/{username}/orgs" string?] {GET (list-user-organizations [])}
    "organizations" {GET (list-organizations [since (s/nilable pos-int?)])}
    ["repos/{owner}/{repo}" string? string?]
    {"assignees" {GET (get-assignees [])}
     "issues" {["{issue_no}" pos-int?] {GET (get-issue [])
                                        "assignees" {POST (add-issue-assignees [^:key assignees (s/coll-of string?)])
                                                     DELETE (remove-issue-assignees [^:key assignees (s/coll-of string?)])}}}}}}
  :defaults {:basic-auth ["user" "personal-token"]})
```

Instead of having URL and basic-auth in rest definition we'd rather have 
a client object that encapsulates them.

```clojure
(defrest
  {["users/{username}/orgs" string?] {GET (list-user-organizations [])}
   "organizations" {GET (list-organizations [since (s/nilable pos-int?)])}
   ["repos/{owner}/{repo}" string? string?]
   {"assignees" {GET (get-assignees [])}
    "issues" {["{issue_no}" pos-int?] {GET (get-issue [])
                                       "assignees" {POST (add-issue-assignees [^:key assignees (s/coll-of string?)])
                                                    DELETE (remove-issue-assignees [^:key assignees (s/coll-of string?)])}}}}})

(defn git-client [url user pass]
  (fn [req]
    (-> req
      (assoc :basic-auth [user pass])
      (update :url #(str url "/" %))
      client/request)))
```

Now we can declare a clients with credentials injected from somewhere. Example:

```clojure
(def cli (git-client "https://api.github.com" "RokLenarcic" "api-key"))
```

And then we can execute request with this object:

```clojure
(cli (list-organizations nil))
```

There are other options:

## Clj-http middleware

Another helper is `prefix-middleware` function in clj-rest-client.core, which returns `clj-http` middleware that prefixes
urls with given prefix. Here's an example:

```clojure
(ns example.core
  (:require [clj-rest-client.core :refer [defrest prefix-middleware]
            [clj-http.client :as client]]))

(defrest {"person" {GET (get-person)}})
; execute request with extra middleware
(client/with-additional-middleware [(prefix-middleware "http://my-server")]
  (client/request (get-person)))
```

Or simply use `set!` or `alter-var-root` or `binding` to add prefix middleware to `client/*current-middleware`.

Or you can make basic host a path param. E.g.

## Host as a param

Another way to make url a parameter:

```clojure
(defrest {"{url}" {"person" {GET (get-person [url string?])}}})
; execute request
(client/request (get-person "http://my-server"))

```

### **[CODE: End state](../t4/t4-end.clj)**

## Production style

In production you will want to reuse `clj-http` connection manager, or your performance will be poor.
