# Tutorial 4 - Reshaping Parameters

Often it is needed that for the purposes of ergonomics there are certain transformations
done on parameters. Here's a few ways to accomplish that.

## Parameter spec

All the parameters have specs. The specs are conformed.

This is one way you can create interfaces where complex types are serialized in
a specific way before going over the wire. 

This library has a ns `clj-rest-client.conform` which already has a couple of helpful conforming specs.

Add it to require:

`[clj-rest-client.conform :refer :all]`

### **[CODE: Current state](t4.clj)**

At this point lets add endpoint that lists all of repositorie's issues:

```clojure
"issues" {GET (list-repo-issues [])
.....

```

This endpoint has a lot of parameters, but we are there's one named `since`,
which is an ISO formatted timestamp string. But we don't want to use string as its spec
but we'd rather use something like `#inst` or `java.time.Instant` instead.

So we define a conforming spec at the top of the namespace:

```clojure
(s/def ::since (->date-format (DateTimeFormatter/ISO_INSTANT)))
```

Now we just add the parameter and the spec:


```clojure
"issues" {GET (list-repo-issues [since (s/nilable ::since)])
.....

```

Calling the function:

```clojure
(list-repo-issues "ansible" "ansible" #inst "2011")
=>
{:clj-rest-client.core/args ["ansible" "ansible" #inst"2011-01-01T00:00:00.000-00:00"],
 :clj-rest-client.core/name clj-rest-client.test/list-repo-issues,
 :url "repos/ansible/ansible/issues",
 :query-params {"since" "2011-01-01T00:00:00Z"},
 :request-method :get,
 :as :json}
```

As you can see the query parameter is a conformed value. This works with `java.time` values and `java.util.Date` values.

You can create your own conforming specs. Here's the other conforming specs in conform namespace:

#### ->json, ->json*

Sometimes you need to convert a query parameter or a part of a bigger parameter to JSON. Use this conformer:

```clojure
(defrest {"example" {GET (example [inline-query-map (s/and map? ->json)])}})
```

Function `->json*` works the same, but it takes a cheshire opt map.

#### ->json?, ->json?*

The previous example spec doesn't take `nil` values, but if you changed `map?` to `(s/nillable map?)` then invoking the function
with `nil` would produce query parameter `inline-query-map=null`. If you want `nil` to stay `nil` (and thus be eliminated from
query parameters) then use var with question mark:

```clojure
(defrest {"example" {GET (example [inline-query-map (s/and (s/nillable map?) ->json?)])}})
```

## Full arg list spec

There's also an overall function spec you can add adding a spec between the
function symbol and parameter vector.

Let's add `state` parameter to endpoint.

```clojure
"issues" {GET (list-repo-issues [state (s/nilable string?) since (s/nilable ::since)])
.....

```

Now let's suppose that we wanted to enforce that if state filter of issues is `"all"` 
then the `since` parameter is mandatory.

Let's add a spec:

```clojure
(s/def ::all-since #(or (not= (:state %) "all") (:since %)))
```

Now simply add it to endpoint definition:

```clojure
"issues" {GET (list-repo-issues ::all-since [since (s/nilable ::since)])
.....

```

You will notice that you cannot leave parameter `since` at `nil` if `state` parameter is `all`.

### **[CODE: End state](t4-end.clj)**
