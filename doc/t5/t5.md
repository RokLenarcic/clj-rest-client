# Tutorial 5 - Varargs parameters

A very common thing in APIs is to have list fetching operations that have tons of
query parameters because there's a lot of filters or modifiers.

Having a function with 8+ parameters and then entering a bunch of `nil` parameters 
in most call-sites can get really ugly and annoying.

To deal with this, we can define varargs parameters.

Our `list-repo-issues` function has multiple filters which are all nullable.

By inserting symbol `&`, you mark all parameters after the symbol as kw-varargs.
All of their specs are automatically wrapped in `[:maybe ...]`.

Let's apply this principle to improve our `list-repo-issues`. In this case, we insert `&` at the start, as both parameters are
optional filters.

```clojure
"issues" {GET (list-repo-issues filtered-function [& state string? since inst?])
```

Let's add all the filters supported by the API:

```clojure
(list-repo-issues filtered-function [&
                               milestone ::milestone
                               state ::issue-state-filter
                               assignee string?
                               creator string?
                               mentioned string?
                               labels ::labels
                               sort #{"created" "updated" "comments"}
                               direction ::sort-dir
                               since ::since])
```

### **[CODE: End state](t5.clj)**

Note the example of spec conforming use in `::label` spec.

Now we can run the function like this:

```clojure
(list-repo-issues "ansible" "ansible" :state "open" :labels ["a" "b"])
=>
{:clj-rest-client.core/args ["ansible" "ansible" nil "open" nil nil nil ["a" "b"] nil],
 :clj-rest-client.core/name clj-rest-client.test/list-repo-issues,
 :url "repos/ansible/ansible/issues",
 :query-params {"labels" "a,b", "state" "open"},
 :request-method :get,
 :as :json}
 ```
