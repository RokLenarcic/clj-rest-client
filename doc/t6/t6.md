# Tutorial 6 - Splitting definition

The API client is working splendidly but it's also getting ugly.

The deep nesting is problematic. Sometimes definition needs to be stitched together from multiple namespaces.

There often are parameters that repeat over and over again and we'd like to avoid doing that.

In this tutorial we'll look at how to reduce repetition in definition.

## Defrest macro definition parameter

Up to this point we defined routes by passing a map literal to defrest macro. But there are other options:

Valid definition parameters any of the following: map literal, a symbol (naming a var that resolves to a map), a string URL. 

The URL can be any valid `java.net.URL` string such as `http://some/url` or `file:my-file.edn`.
Additionally `classpath:` urls are supported, such as `classpath:my-definition.edn`.
You can add custom protocols via the normal Java custom url handlers and cmd switch `-Djava.protocol.handler.pkgs=org.my.protocols`. 

Let's leverage this to reduce visual noise from nesting. When reading from a variable, the tricky part is that
you have to quote variables. Luckily `defrest` can handle namespaced symbols so we can use syntax quoting and splice in what we need.

### **[CODE: Definition split up](t6-reorg.clj)**

Take a look at the new definition. We use unquote splicing to piece together whole definition.

Often you have clusters of parameters that repeat often, like having `sort`, `sort-dir` on all list operations, which can be simplified by syntax quoting and unquoting common formats.

We'll add an example function:

### **[CODE: Definition functions](t6-fns.clj)**

You will notice that we added `list-params` function which adds 3 params to give parameter vector.
The gains in our case are non-existent, but imagine describing an API that has same 3 parameters on a few dozen endpoints.

We added `issue-query` value and reused it in three different
endpoints.

Also note how it adds `&` as needed.

### Dealing with endpoints that break pattern

It is common to have an API where 95% of endpoints return JSON (and thus warrants the use of :json-responses option),
and yet have 5% of endpoints where that isn't the case.

One way to deal with this is to simply use two `defrest` with different defaults. E.g.:

```clojure
(defrest {"majority" ... define 95% of endpoints here})
(defrest {"special" ... define 5% of endpoints here} :json-bodies false)
```

Or simply find the minority cases and use the extras map to override the default:

```clojure
(defrest {"special" {"endpoint" {GET (get-file {:as :bytes})}}})
```

Here we override the default `:as :json` for outstanding endpoints on a case by case basis.
