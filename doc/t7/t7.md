# Tutorial 7 - A different way to describe API

So far we've specified API by putting together a nested map.

There is no particular reason why we cannot specify the API differently.

The tools available allow for different styles depending on personal preference. Here's an example
that leverages default method mechanism combined with using multiple `defrest` macros and full paths.

### **[CODE: Starting point](../t6/t6_fns.clj)**

### **[CODE: Flat Definition](t7.clj)**

In the end it's a matter of personal preference.
