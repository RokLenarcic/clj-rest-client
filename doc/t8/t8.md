# Tutorial 8 - Fun with paging

Github API list endpoints return a limited amount of data, and it uses paging.

Paging is handled by Links header which `clj-http` parses into a link element in response such as:

```
:links {:next {:href "https://api.github.com/organizations?since=3043"}, 
        :first {:href "https://api.github.com/organizations{?since}"}
```
